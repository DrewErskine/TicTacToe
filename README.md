# Scala Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the Scala Tic Tac Toe game, an interactive command-line version of the classic game implemented in Scala. This application allows you to play Tic Tac Toe against an AI opponent or another player, utilizing a simple but effective command-line interface.

## Game Components

The game consists of several Scala files that handle different aspects of the game:

- **Board.scala**: Manages the game board, including displaying the board state, placing marks, and checking win conditions.
- **GameStatus.scala**: Defines the game's possible states such as in progress, won, and draw.
- **Player.scala**: Represents a player, handling player details such as the marker type (X or O) and whether the player is an AI.
- **TicTacToe.scala**: Contains the main game loop and integrates all components to run the game.

## Features

- Play against an AI or a human opponent.
- Command-line interface for input and output.
- Automatic checking of game state (win, draw, in progress).
